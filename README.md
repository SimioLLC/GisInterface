# GIS Interface
Demonstrates a Simio AddIn that gets data from GIS APIs (only Bing Maps is currently implemented) to create Simio model objects.
A form is used to prompt the user for source and destination cities. Bing Maps is then queried for a route, and Simio nodes and links are constructed from the data.

Note: The users must go to Bing Maps to get a free license.
